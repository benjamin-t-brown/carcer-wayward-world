Dialog Guidelines

- Be succinct with dialog.  It should not be often that characters spew monologues.
  - this isn't an attempt to be more realistic, it's more to keep the word count down and easier to read.
  - the more you write, the more darlings you have to kill
- By default, skill checks should not be told to the player, but they can be turned in in difficulty settings
  - The player will always choose skill check for their highest skill, it takes the fun out of it if the skill check is told to them at the start.  This is part of role playing.
    - PROBLEM Skill check text might not be consistent with what a player thinks should be the skill check
      - This happens in DnD all the time and it's a minor problem.
      - Can be mitigated with the difficulty setting to show skill checks.
      - Can be mitigated by saying that the choice has skill checks somewhere in the responses, but not indicating what they are
    - Players should know a skill check happened though, and what kind it was but only AFTER it happens.
    - Will players just save scum this or wiki this anyway?
  - Maybe not a "difficulty" setting, maybe a "gameplay" setting

Gameplay Guidelines

- The world should be open, but zoned
  - Open world games are very daunting at first.  It is more digestible to have semi-enclosed zones with soft boundaries.
  - The player shouldn't be explicitly discouraged from exploring outside these zones.
    - No hard invisible walls.
    - If a player stumbles upon something, there should be narrative accounted for them finding it on their own rather than having been told about it.  The player should know that some place is part of an existing quest rather than just some random place.
      - NOTE This happens to me a lot in open world rpgs.  Especially janky ones.  In Fallout New Vegas, I very often just ran off into the mountains and discover big, crazy places which are part of side quests.  But I don't know that.  So I follow the whole quest line to what I think is the completion, but I'm never told to go back anyplace to finish it.  It has made me want to stay more on the beaten path for the sake of things being less janky, which I don't like.
  - Inter-zonal quests should be limited early-on and easy to distinguish.
    - As the player gets more comfortable with the world, these quests can be opened up
      - NOTE Zelda BOTW solves this by having the same pattern of quest show up in each zone, worth considering?
- The player should know as much as possible what they are doing and why
  - If a player discovers a cave with a quest, it should be clear why they are there, or at least it should be clear that the cave holds a quest (even if not yet discovered).
  - NOTE When going through missions for Mass Effect/WOTR I was often confused about why I was there in the first place.  Stuff would happen, characters would appear, and I wouldn't know or understand the situation.  On the first play through, I often ended up confused and with a sense of anticlimatic "okay I guess that happened" when I didn't get why I knew about a certain location somebody told me about 3 hours ago.  I feel like this happens mostly with mission-based games.  You see a dot on the map you can go to, tells you which companions you need to take, then you just sort of end up there in the middle of the story without any setup (because the setup is talking to the quest giver who tells you about the location).  It would be nice to have a summary of why I know about this place, who gave me the quest, and why I care.
- The game should not overly-rely on combat.  Some people like combat, that's cool, but this game should be more than just fighting all the time.
- Factions should play a major part in the game, and force the player to make decisions about who to support.
  - But the player should know what these factions are and what they represent before being asked to support a side.
    - NOTE This is what I think Spiderweb games are weakest at, with the exception of the first Geneforge.
- Inventory management should exist, but it should be simple.
  - Reduce inventory junk, and de-emphasize mass looting.
  - Inventory management: some like it some don't.  I personally don't like clicking "loot all" on everything because I never look at what I picked up and it just ends up in an endless list somewhere.  It should be obvious when getting something that is a great upgrade or when getting something rare.
    - NOTE Sometimes players miss quests that give them weapon upgrades.  If you hype up a lvl 4 weapon to a lvl 6 player, it can have some narrative dissonance.  It would be nice to inform the player that the item isn't up to snuff for them if they are past the level of the quest.  Cross Code does this explicitly by telling the player up front what level the quest is and what the rewards are.  That does remove some mystique about it though.
- Reduce the player's urge to quicksave and reload as much as possible; don't completely prevent this though.
  - The player should be encouraged to play the game as is without requiring luck to always be on their side. Spam reloading isn't fun (for most people).
  - Don't remove quick save/load.  It is a nice tool.
  - Remove mechanics which promote save-reloading
    - Traps: Don't have a "traps" or "awareness" skill.  If you must have traps, make them disarmable if the player themselves is vigilant, not their pc.
    - Lockpick Chance: Locked doors should not have a percent chance of breaking lockpicks, as this encourages players to reload if they lose too many.
- The money economy should not be trivial to circumvent, until later on in the game
  - Lots of rpgs it irks me that it's easy for players to just do some exploit for money.  This should be a real problem to think about, because it makes for more engaging decisions about "what to do next".

Combat

- Should be quick and snappy: easy enemies should be quick to dispatch
  - NOTE My most recent play through of Blades of Exile: Valley of the Dying things showed me that fast fights are indeed quite fun.  If you are at the right level you should blast through easy encounters without issue.  In BOE, some parts of it are fast (like movement, enemy turns, basic attacks), and some are tedious (waiting for sound effects, using spells with the mouse, waiting for enemy ai to come to you).  A good game allows the player to play at their speed, even if it is ludicrously quick such that spectators cannot keep up.
- Not all fights should be easy, there should be involved challenges.
- Don't rely on padding runtime with enemy spawns.
  - NOTE BOE VODT had respawning monsters in dungeons and this was NOT fun.
- Be creative. Levels in stats shouldn't only increase damage by a percentage.
- Take chances.  Don't be conservative.  Let the game have overpowered stuff.
