Balance

Early Game
Early game balance should likely be very similar to BOE.  I see it like this:

 - Power stat checks determine how carefully you have to progress through a room
 - Fighters are generally not all that strong, often missing until they level up and get better gear
 - Mages are very strong with access to Haste/Range attack/Aoe/
 - Priests are utility focused with Heal/Restore/Bless
  - Priests can also provide other utility like provide food/unlock/show light
  - Priests have only source of true damage in early game
 - Archers make efficient use of AP but arrows do nerfed damage
 - Deep dungeons require a small amount of attrition and choosing when to wait, as mages run out of AP
 - Usage of potions is probably very over powered
 - Enemies use weak statuses poison/web/slow/
 - Enemies are dumb and don't attack priority targets

Mid Game
  - Fighters become considerably stronger and can jump
  - Mages scale with mass bless/haste/aoe/Teleport
    - Spells cost considerably more than in early game, attrition much harder
  - Archers can now use specific damage attacks to circumvent resistances
  - Enemies start to develop some resistances
  - Enemies develop better targeting
  - Enemies use stronger statuses disease/dumbfound/acid
  - Enemies litter the battle with fields conflagration,poison,cold
  - Enemies can have higher base AP

Late Game
  - Fighters are incredibly strong with proper pre-buffs
    - Fighters have most mobility, can jump, have most AP efficiency
  - Mages aoe and damage become much less effective
    - Their power shifts to buffing and utility
    - Rare case where kill spell does most damage compared to other uses
  - Priests provide dispel and antimagic utility
  - Archers have reliable source of true damage with special arrows
  - Enemies have many resistances
  - Enemies implement teleport and jump in their ai
  - Enemies use strongest statuses martyr's shield/antimagic/slow field
