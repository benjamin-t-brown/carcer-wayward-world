The game area is split up into two major modes of transportation and time:

- Overworld Travel
- Town/Dungeon Travel

Time passing and Food: 

Time is tracked by days since arrival on Sadelica.  Each day requires the player to eat 1 ration of food.  If the player does not have enough food, they gain Exhaustion status.  If they have 4 points of this status, they die.

Towns/Dungeons

Time is delineated by how often the player has to consume rations.  In a town, this is once every 10 minutes.
  - In a town, players do not consume food from inventory, instead it is handled automatically (comes from tavern or whatever)
  - In a dungeon, food is consumed from the player's inventory.
  - Player 1 and Player 2 do not share a food storage.  They consume food at different rates if they leave the town at different times.

Overworld

Rations are consumed by number of tiles traveled in the Overworld.




While in a town the Player and any Coop partner can freely roam throughout the town.  They can each have conversations separately and explore the map with shared vision.
