How attacks are performed
  Attacker rolls some number of d6
  Defender has Armor stat which indicates how many successes it takes to hit them.
  A success is a 5 or a 6.
  These dice explode. If a 6 is rolled, an additional dice is rolled.
  A crit occurs if Attacker rolls only 6s for successes.
  - On a hit

      - a crit adds max damage of rolls to this roll
