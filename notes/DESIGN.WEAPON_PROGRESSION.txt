Each tier of weapon grants additional damage, typically in the vein of 1d4.  Higher, rare weapon tiers might just nerf this to +1 instead.

Weapons can be augmented an a number of ways.  Each augmentation is a temporary status effect that applies to the weapon.

Sharpened - Damage dice are rolled with advantage.
Dipped in Poison - Attacking and hitting somebody gives them Poisoned status effect.
Charged - Sapphiron energy grants the weapon + 1 damage.

Range Weapons have different classes that fill certain niches of apt-ness

Bows+Arrows - the most difficult to master, but will grant the player the most benefit in the long run.
Crossbows+Bolts - once the player has Crossbow Training, crossbows will always be useful, but never amazing 
Thrown darts - Throwing darts is the entry-level throwing weapon, useful early if you have no skill with them but they have a limited damage cap
Thrown knives - If you are better at thrown weapons, you might opt to use knives which have higher damage potential but are harder to use.
Thrown shurikans - Shurikans are the hardest to master, but have the most potential for damage.
