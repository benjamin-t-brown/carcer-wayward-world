# Cpp UI guidelines

- all ui elements must be put in the ui folder.
- all ui elements must exist in the 'ui' namespace.
- all ui elements must extend the class UiElement.
- all ui elements must be constructed with at least an sdl2w window pointer and an optional parent element.

## UiElement
- when overriding "set" methods, ensure that "build" is called to rebuild the component after changing properties.
- when adding children to a children property, use "getChildren().push_back".
- when overriding any methods, ensure that the overrides account for style, props, and children if they are applicable.
