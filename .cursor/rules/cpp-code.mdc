# Cpp code guidelines
- use camelCase for variable names and UpperCase for class or struct names
- prefer usage of std::vector over std::array or raw arrays
- prefer using std::unique_ptr or std::optional instead of raw pointers
- all cpp functions must be in a cpp file and not declared inline.
- every cpp file must be explicitly defined in the source file.
- all classes must exist within a namespace, if the namespace is the top level use the "program" namespace.
- prefer declaring variables with auto instead of the type, like: "auto a = int{1}".
- use structs for any groups of data or classes that have no methods.
- prefer const references if passing by reference.
- prefer using LOG macro from "lib/sdl2w/Logger.h" instead of iostream or printf
- prefer cpp standard library instead of c standard library
- mark override when a method is overridden
